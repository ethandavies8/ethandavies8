Greetings, my name is Ethan Davies, and I am a current computer science student.  I am interested in front end/web development, as well as full stack development.
I am currently in the process of teaching myself html, css, and javascript.  I already have experience working with C# and Java.  I am currently just trying to improve my skills as much as possible, and grow in experience so I can get an internship.  As part of this process of improving my skillset, I have decided to build a website where I can document my projects and write about my learning.  I personally find this to be a very useful tool to keep me progressing in my knowledge.  My website can be found in the website repository, and the other repositories represent personal projects.

If you would like to contact me, you can reach me at ethandavies8@gmail.com.
