My name is Ethan Davies and I am a computer science student at the University of Utah set to graduate in May 2024. I am currently looking for an internship in full stack development or front end/web development. I have industry experience doing front end automated testing as an intern at the University of Utah. I have also held a management position at KFC starting at age 16 for two years leading a team of six people. I have made honor roll nearly every semester and I take pride in trying to always learn new things and challenge myself. 

I have experience working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, Java, and databases. 

My current coursework includes Databases, Algorithms, Computer Security, and Models of Computation. Other important classes of note previously taken are Probability and Statistics, Discrete Math, Data Structures.
