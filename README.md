My name is Ethan Davies and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Utah set to graduate in May 2024. I am currently looking for an internship in full stack development or back end development. I have industry experience doing front end automated testing as an intern at the University of Utah. I have also held a management position starting at age 16 for two years leading a team of six people at a seperate position. I have made honor roll nearly every semester and I take pride in my hard work ethic. I love learning new things, included below is my website repository which I created to document my own growth journey as I became a better programmer. I came up with this idea because it drove me to continually be learning while also keeping myself accountable for that learning in a constructive way. Starting the website led to the creation of the 2048 and LeetCode repositories so I could document my progress on a project as well as my progress learning new algorithms and practicing using different data structures.

My Public Repositories: 

Team-Building-Project: This is my current project I am actively working on. Built in vue and in collaboration with an industry professional we are building a team generator. This will be a server hosted web application that stores user data such as their friends, teams created, individual player scores for different games, usernames and passwords.

Educational-App: This was a school project made by me and 3 other people. The assignment was to create an app aimed to educate on a specific topic, our topic was logical operators in circuits. This application teaches how different logical operators work and then has the user practice using each operator in a circuit, eventually ending in creating an adder circuit using what they have learned.

Pixel-Editor-Animator: This was another school project made by me and 3 other people. This application allows the user to create custom pixel sprites of various sizes
and even create animations for those sprites. The sprites and animations can be saved and loaded.

Website: This is a personal project where I wanted to challenge myself to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development and also lay the foundation for my own website I could use to post my projects and major project updates. I plan to continue to expand this website as I create new projects and continue to expand my learning.

2048 Game: This is the game 2048 recreated as a windows application, it was a fairly popular 2012 app.

LeetCode: This has my solutions to various leetcode problems over several years.

I have experience working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, Java, and databases. 

My current coursework includes Databases, Algorithms, Computer Security, and Models of Computation. Other important classes of note previously taken are Probability and Statistics, Discrete Math, and Data Structures.
